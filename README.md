======================
A simple man by the name of Blyatmir once had a dream to unite the lands of russia via hard work and compasssion. One day he created the USSR and via the blyat powers invested in him he united all the lands and became Blyatmir Putin!. Years after the rise of Blyatmir Putin, the freedom man appeared with promises of lands filled with vodka and adidas tracksuits. In complete astonishment Blyatmir took up the offer and struck a deal with the freedom mans. Years later the freedom man betrayed Blyatmir and stole his sticks away from him. Now Blaytmir must retake what was stolen from him. This is the story of Blyatmir Putin.
